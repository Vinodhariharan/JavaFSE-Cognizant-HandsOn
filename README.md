## Conclusion

The **Java Full Stack Engineer (JavaFSE)** DeepSkill Program under Cognizant Digital Nurture 4.0 was a valuable learning experience that bridged the gap between theory and practice.  
Through a well-structured, hands-on approach, it covered everything from core Java concepts and backend development with Spring Boot to modern frontend development using ReactJS, along with essential tools like Git and GitHub.  

**By the end of the program, I have gained the confidence and skills to design, develop, and deploy full-stack applications using industry-standard technologies and best practices.**
